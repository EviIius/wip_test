Summarization: Took the original prompt and slightly shortened it, not really a summarization
CASE is an enterprise support platform designed for over 20,000 data scientists, data analysts, MLOps engineers, and BI developers at a bank. It offers various features including "CASEY," an intent-driven chatbot microservice built using Microsoft Copilot Studio, the Collective Intelligence (CI) framework, a conditional ticketing system, and MS Graph-enabled search. These features allow product and support teams to effectively address customer needs, manage product knowledge documentation, and handle product inquiries within a single platform.

Grammar Checking: Gave a list rather than a corrected version of text, along with its thoughts.
The input text appears to be grammatically correct. However, there are a few suggestions for improvement:

In the first sentence, consider using "enterprise support platform" instead of just "platform". This will make it clearer what type of platform you are referring to.
In the second sentence, consider rephrasing "a microservice built on MS Copilot Studio" to "a microservice built with Microsoft Copilot Studio." This will make it clearer how the microservice was built.
In the third sentence, consider replacing "product and support teams" with "support teams" to make it clear who is responsible for managing the platform.
In the fourth sentence, add a comma after "Collective Intelligence (CI)" to separate it from the rest of the sentence.
In the last sentence, consider replacing "handle product inquiries" with "manage customer inquiries" to make it clear what the platform is designed to do.
