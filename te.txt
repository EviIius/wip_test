Created a consolidated guide outlining best practices for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), with color-coded performance indicators for different prompt types.
Included various tested techniques such as Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which performed effectively.
Serves as a reference guide for coworkers, providing a starting point for selecting and working with different models.
