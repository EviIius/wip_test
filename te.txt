QAQC relies on guidelines and internal documents to ensure accuracy.
Without clear documentation, results may be inconsistent across different formats and use cases.
System prompts help but may miss key details, especially for model validation.
QAQC works best with human review or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Even a simple file upload can improve accuracy and performance.
