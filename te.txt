Developed a consolidated sheet containing best practices for prompting multiple Large Language Models (LLMs).
Implemented color coding to indicate which models produced the most refined outputs for different prompt types.
Included a variety of tested prompting techniques (e.g., Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT)) that performed effectively.
Designed as a reference guide for coworkers, providing a starting point for selecting and working with different models.
