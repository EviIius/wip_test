The Central Analytics Support & Enablement (CASE) platform is an enterprise support system, serving over 20,000 data scientists, data analysts, MLOps engineers, BI developers, and other professionals at the bank.

CASE features a range of capabilities, including CASEY, a chatbot microservice built on Microsoft Copilot Studio, which is driven by intent rather than general artificial intelligence (AI) or large language models (LLMs).

Additionally, CASE incorporates the Collective Intelligence (CI) framework, a conditional ticketing system, and Microsoft Graph-enabled search functionality.

By providing a unified platform, CASE enables product and support teams to efficiently address customer needs, manage knowledge documentation, and handle product inquiries in a streamlined manner.

Reworded “All of this enables” to "By providing a unified platform, CASE enables" for improved readability.
Changed “handle product inquiries with a unified platform” to “handle product inquiries in a streamlined manner” for clarity and precision.
