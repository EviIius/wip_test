QAQC stands for Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC), a systematic process to ensure products and services meet quality standards.

Quality Assurance (QA)
Focuses on audits, training, and documentation to ensure consistency and reliability.
Quality Control (QC)
Detects and corrects defects through testing, inspections, and verification before or after delivery.
Why is QAQC Important?
Maintains safety, efficiency, and regulatory compliance across industries.
Challenges Without Supplementary Information
QAQC relies on internal guidelines for accuracy.
Lack of documentation causes inconsistent results across formats and use cases.
System prompts may miss key details, especially in model validation.
Human review or AI-assisted tools (RAG) improve accuracy.
Simple file uploads can enhance performance.
