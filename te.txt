CASE is a comprehensive platform that supports data science and analytics professionals at the bank. It provides a range of features, including a chatbot, a ticketing system, and a search engine. CASE enables product and support teams to efficiently address customer needs, manage product knowledge, and handle inquiries.

Explanation:
The original text is quite verbose and uses a lot of jargon. The paraphrased text is more concise and uses simpler language.

Here are some specific changes made:
Replaced "Central Analytics Support & Enablement (CASE)" with "CASE is a comprehensive platform" – This is a more direct and concise way to introduce the platform.
Replaced "multiple features such as…" with "It provides a range of features, including…" – This removes the need for a list and makes the text more concise.
Replaced "CASEY chatbot, an intent-driven (i.e., non-Gen AI/non-LLM) chatbot microservice built on MS Copilot Studio" with "a chatbot, a ticketing system, and a search engine" – This simplifies the description of the chatbot and focuses on the key features.
Replaced "All of this enables product and support teams to efficiently address customer needs, manage their product knowledge documentation, and handle product inquiries within a unified platform" with "CASE enables product and support teams to efficiently address customer needs, manage product knowledge, and handle inquiries." – This removes unnecessary words and makes the sentence more direct.


CASE, our enterprise support platform for the ~20K+ data scientists, data analysts, MLOps engineers, BI developers, etc. at the bank, includes multiple features such as the CASEY chatbot, an intent-driven chatbot microservice built on MS Copilot Studio. CASE also includes the Collective Intelligence (CI) framework, a conditional ticketing system, and MS Graph-enabled search. This unified platform enables product and support teams to efficiently address customer needs, manage product knowledge documentation, and handle product inquiries.

Explanation of Changes:

Combined Sentences: Combining the sentences about CASE features into one for better flow and readability.
Specific Language: Replacing vague words like "efficiently address customer needs" with more specific language like "efficiently address customer needs, manage product knowledge documentation, and handle product inquiries."
