Our models are evaluated based on the following key considerations:

Generation Structure – Assessing the coherence and logical flow of outputs.
Interpretability & Explainability – Ensuring clarity in model decision-making when given specific context.
Computational Efficiency & Latency – Optimizing resource usage and response time based on token requirements.
Task-Specific vs. General Purpose Performance – Comparing specialized model outputs to broader, general-use responses.
Additionally, while bias and toxicity are areas of concern, their impact is more challenging to assess in a strictly technical summarization context.
